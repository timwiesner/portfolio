Welcome to my personal portfolio website.

Refactor notes:
1. Update Bootstrap layout with appropriate .row and .col divs
2. Alter SCSS compiler to expanded, placing closing brackets on new lines
3. Add target "blank" so links open in new tabs, not windows
4. TODO: Use srcset to optimize images for various screen sizes
